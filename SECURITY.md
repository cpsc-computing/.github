Constraint-Projected State Computing (CPSC)

This document describes how to report security vulnerabilities related to
the CPSC specifications, reference materials, and associated artifacts.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability, **do not open a public issue**.

Please report security issues privately via email:

- **Email:** support@bitconcepts.tech
- **Subject:** CPSC Security Disclosure

This applies to:
- specification ambiguities with security impact
- binary format parsing issues
- potential exploit vectors
- hardware or reconstruction edge cases
- denial-of-service or integrity concerns

---

## What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- A clear description of the issue
- The affected document(s) or component(s)
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
- Potential impact
- Any suggested mitigations (optional)

Clear and concise reports help us respond faster.

## Disclosure Process

1. We will acknowledge receipt of your report.
2. The issue will be reviewed privately.
3. If confirmed, we will determine appropriate remediation.
4. Fixes or clarifications may be released in a future specification update.
5. Public disclosure will occur only after mitigation or at our discretion.

## Coordinated Disclosure

We follow a **coordinated disclosure** model.
