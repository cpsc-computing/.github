# Constraint-Projected State Computing (CPSC)
## High-Level Overview

**Audience:** engineers, architects, and technically literate readers.  
**Status:** high-level explainer, not legal or claim language.

---

## 1. What problem is CPSC trying to solve?

Most computing today is either:

- **Instruction-driven**: you write code that executes step by step, mutating state along the way, or
- **Model-driven**: you train a neural network or other learned system and trust its outputs.

Both approaches work well in many domains, but they have weaknesses when you care about:

- Hard **safety envelopes** ("this must never happen"),
- **Determinism** and replay ("same inputs, same outputs, always"),
- Strong **invariants** and correctness conditions ("these relationships must always hold"),
- Long-term **governance** across heterogeneous backends (classical CPUs, accelerators, quantum, AI, etc.).

Constraint-Projected State Computing (CPSC) responds by flipping the model:

> Instead of treating code or models as the ultimate source of truth, CPSC treats **constraints** as the source of truth, and treats everything else as a source of **proposals** that must be projected back into a constraint-defined space.

---

## 2. Core idea in one sentence

CPSC defines computation as:

> **Projecting** system state into a space defined by explicit constraints, and committing only those states that satisfy all constraints.

There is:

- No notion of "the program counter is here, so this must be correct," and
- No notion of "the model predicted this, so it must be correct."

Instead:

- You declare what combinations of variables are allowed (constraints),
- Components propose changes,
- A **projection engine** snaps proposals back into the legal space (or rejects them).

Figure: CPSC as a constraint-projected truth table. All possible states form a conceptual grid; constraints carve out a legal manifold, and proposals are snapped onto that manifold at epoch commit boundaries.

## 3. Simple mechanical analogy (no heavy math)

Imagine all possible ways your system could be configured:

- Every sensor reading, flag, register, field, and actuator command.
- We can picture this as a huge grid:
  - Each **column** = one variable,
  - Each **row** = one complete assignment to all variables.

Now:

1. **Constraints rule out bad rows**

   - You write constraints like:
     - "If brake is on, throttle must be off."
     - "Checksum must match the payload."
     - "This policy flag must always be consistent with that role."
   - Together, they carve out a subset of **legal rows** in the grid.

2. **The legal rows are the "constraint manifold"**

   - Think of this as the shape of all acceptable states.
   - Everything outside is invalid or unsafe.

3. **Components only propose**

   - A neural network, a planning algorithm, or a user proposes:
     - "Heres where I want the system to be next."
   - That proposal might be partial, inconsistent, or outright illegal with respect to the constraints.

4. **Projection = snapping onto the legal region**

   - A projection engine:
     - Takes the proposal,
     - Uses the constraints to "snap" it onto a legal row if possible, and
     - Either:
       - Returns a corrected, legal state, or
       - Deterministically reports failure.

5. **Degrees of freedom (DoFs)**

   - Many columns are not truly independent (theyre fixed or derived).
   - CPSC explicitly identifies:
     - **Free / DoF variables**  independent choices,
     - **Derived variables**  always computed from constraints,
     - **Fixed variables**  invariant.
   - You can often store/transmit just the DoFs and reconstruct the rest via projection.

6. **Epochs and commits**

   - Time is broken into **epochs**:
     - Within an epoch, proposals and internal iterations happen.
     - But the **committed state** doesnt change until a commit boundary.
   - At commit:
     - The system atomically switches to a new legal state, or
     - Stays where it is (if projection fails).
   - This is similar to:
     - A clock edge in hardware,
     - A transaction commit in a database.

---

## 4. Why this matters (practically)

CPSC gives you:

- A **clean separation** between:
  - What is allowed (constraints), and
  - Who is proposing (code, models, users, other backends).
- A **deterministic** and testable core:
  - Same initial state + same DoFs + same constraints > same projected state.
- A natural way to:
  - Enforce **safety envelopes**,
  - Define **policy** and **governance** in a backend-agnostic way,
  - Integrate or swap different execution backends (classical, AI, quantum) without changing the semantics of "whats allowed."

## 5. Hardware mental model (constraint fabric)

In hardware, CPSC looks less like a CPU and more like a **constraint fabric**:

- **State registers** hold the committed legal state.
- **DoF input registers** accept incoming degrees of freedom (from a stream, bus, or host).
- **Constraint evaluation logic** evaluates relevant constraints in parallel or in structured stages.
- A **projection/update network** applies bounded corrections or recomputes derived signals.
- **Convergence detection** decides when all constraints are satisfied (or when to give up).
- **Commit logic** updates the state registers at the clock edge.

There is no requirement for:

- Instruction memory, or
- A general-purpose program counter.

Instead, you compile constraints into hardware structures that deterministically enforce them.

## 6. Software mental model (state resolver)

Figure: Inside a CPSC state resolver. Proposed degrees of freedom flow into a deterministic, bounded loop of constraint evaluation and update/relaxation until a valid state is found or failure is reported.

In software, CPSC looks like a **state resolver** or **deterministic solver**, not a typical algorithm:

- You define:
  - A **state struct** with named fields,
  - A set of **pure constraint predicates** over that struct.
- You run a **projection engine** that:
  - Takes a partial or proposed state,
  - Applies a deterministic loop under explicit numeric rules,
  - Returns either a fully valid state or a structured failure.
- You treat this as:
  - A transaction (epoch),
  - With an atomic commit of the resolved state.

Predictive components (e.g., neural networks):

- Propose candidate values for some fields or degrees of freedom,
- Do not determine correctness,
- Can be removed or swapped without changing the constraint semantics.

## 7. Relationship to CPAC (Constraint-Projected Adaptive Compression)

Constraint-Projected Adaptive Compression (CPAC) is a compression scheme built directly on CPSC:

- Stage 1: **Projection & DoF extraction**
  - Map raw data into a structured state according to a constraint model.
  - Project onto the constraint-defined space.
  - Extract the DoF vector as a minimal representation.

- Stage 2: **Prediction (optional)**
  - Predict DoFs using classical or learned predictors.
  - Form residuals or distributions.

- Stage 3: **Entropy coding**
  - Apply a standard entropy coder over residuals / DoFs.

On decode:

- Entropy decode > reconstruct DoFs,
- Inject DoFs into the same constraint-based model,
- Project back to full state.

Because constraints are enforced on both sides, reconstruction can be both exact and structurally validated.

---

## 8. Summary

- **CPSC** says: "Computation is projecting state into a constraint-defined space."
- It provides a clean way to separate **policy and invariants** from the mechanisms that propose changes.
- Hardware and software realizations both fall naturally out of the same idea.
