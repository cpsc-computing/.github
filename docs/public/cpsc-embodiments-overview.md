## 2. Application Embodiments (Section 11)

This section summarizes the non-exhaustive application embodiments from
Section 11 of the provisional.

### 2.1 E-11.1: Constraint Optimization and Satisfiability

Optimization and SAT problems are expressed as constraint systems over
variables, and CPSC projection evolves candidate assignments deterministically
until they either satisfy all constraints or fail under declared bounds.
Unlike ad-hoc solver loops, projection is part of the core execution model,
with determinism and convergence behavior specified explicitly.

### 2.2 E-11.2: Configuration, Planning, and Scheduling

Configurations, plans, and schedules are modeled as state with explicit degrees
of freedom and constraints representing resources, dependencies, and policies.
Given a proposed configuration or schedule, CPSC projects it into the valid
region or reports failure, making planning a matter of state projection rather
than imperative conflict resolution.

### 2.3 E-11.3: Policy and Authorization Enforcement

Access control decisions are derived from requests, policies, and resource
state encoded as constraints; projection determines whether any valid state
exists in which the request is allowed. This yields deterministic, auditable
policy enforcement where correctness is expressed declaratively, not scattered
across conditional branches.

### 2.4 E-11.4: Real-Time Control and Safety Envelopes

In control systems, desired actuator commands are proposed based on feedback
and targets, but CPSC projects these proposals into constraint-defined safety
envelopes (e.g., rate, position, or energy limits). The final output is always
consistent with declared safety bounds, independent of controller heuristics or
implementation details.

### 2.5 E-11.5: Autonomous and Robotic Systems

Candidate trajectories or actions from planners and learned policies are
interpreted as proposed states or sequences that must satisfy dynamic,
kinematic, and safety constraints. CPSC acts as a safety and policy layer that
accepts or rejects these proposals based solely on constraint satisfaction,
separating motion feasibility and safety from the particulars of the planner.

### 2.6 E-11.6: AI and Learned-System Governance

Outputs from learned models (including large language models) are mapped into
structured state spaces where policy, safety, or structural rules are
specified. CPSC projection then enforces those rules—e.g., ensuring that
allocations, recommendations, or decisions respect constraints—without
requiring the model itself to be trusted or interpretable.

### 2.7 E-11.7: Constraint-Governed Smart Control Plane for Realms and Resources

Datacenter resources, heterogeneous compute fabrics, and distributed execution
environments are modeled as constrained state spaces comprising realms,
workloads, resources, policies, and service-level objectives. A
constraint-projected control plane treats all scheduling, allocation,
migration, and governance decisions as proposed state transitions that must
project into constraint-satisfying configurations before acceptance. This
architecture provides deterministic governance, mathematically enforceable
policies, unified multi-scheduler support, and auditability. Hardware
embodiments enable line-rate governance with microsecond-scale accept/reject
decisions for real-time admission control. Applications include datacenter
orchestration, edge computing with heterogeneous accelerators, HPC clusters,
NFV, autonomous vehicle compute platforms, and hybrid quantum-classical
systems.

### 2.8 E-11.8: Telemetry, Logging, and Replay

Telemetry frames and logs are treated as partially observed state, and CPSC
projection reconstructs a minimal, constraint-consistent representation while
flagging inconsistencies. This enables deterministic replay and analysis, where
any corruption or tampering manifests as projection failure or structural
anomalies.

### 2.9 E-11.9: Embedded and Low-Power Systems

CPSC supports embedded and low-power designs by replacing complex control logic
with constraint projection on a compact state representation, avoiding heavy
neural inference or deep stacks of imperative code. Determinism, explainability,
and bounded resource use are first-class design targets.

### 2.10 E-11.10: CPAC Core Compression Pipeline

CPAC uses CPSC as its front-end: raw data are injected into a
constraint-architected state, projected to a minimal degree-of-freedom vector,
optionally predicted, and then entropy-coded. This separates semantic
structure (captured by constraints and DoFs) from statistical modeling and
coding, making the transform both deterministic and explainable.

### 2.11 E-11.11: Quantum and Non-Von-Neumann Backends

A single semantic system specification and constraint architecture define the
problem, while quantum, neuromorphic, analog, or other non-Von-Neumann
backends act as proposal or computation engines underneath. CPSC provides a
stable intent layer above these backends, so hardware can be swapped or
combined without changing the semantics of correctness.

### 2.12 E-11.12: Learned Predictors for CPAC and General Structure-Induction

Learned predictors operate only in the DoF space produced by CPAC's
constraint projection, outputting predicted DoFs or distributions used by
entropy coders. Correctness and losslessness remain defined entirely by CPSC;
learned components influence efficiency, not validity. Beyond compression,
learned structure-induction techniques apply to cryptographic state proposal,
configuration generation, and scheduling. Learned models are organized by
structural classes (block-structured, record-oriented, header-payload,
temporally correlated, algebraically constrained, or opaque spaces) rather
than domain-specific formats, enabling generalization across heterogeneous
data sources. Learned stages are optional, deterministic when present, and
degrade gracefully on negative cases without compromising correctness.

### 2.13 E-11.13: Constraint-Projected PQC Execution and Variants

Post-quantum cryptographic algorithms are expressed as constrained
cryptographic state, with signatures, ciphertexts, and keys represented as
DoFs and all other structure reconstructed via projection. Multiple variants
cover pure execution, CPAC-coupled state handling, governance and formal
verification, and full communication/key-management stacks; in all cases,
validity is determined by satisfying cryptographic constraints, not by
branch-heavy procedural code.

### 2.14 E-11.14: Constraint-Projected Structural Malware Discovery

Malware detection is reframed as a constraint satisfaction problem: payloads
are mapped into structured state spaces representing format invariants
(headers, sections, entry points, integrity fields), and CPSC projection
determines whether the payload can exist as a valid state. If projection fails,
the payload is structurally invalid and treated as malicious. Streaming
operation allows early detection as data arrives incrementally, without
buffering complete payloads. Unlike signature or heuristic approaches, this
method reduces false positives by rejecting only payloads that violate explicit
structural constraints, and operates deterministically with reproducible
outcomes across implementations. Applications include executable formats (ELF,
PE, Mach-O), firmware images, network protocols, and document formats with
embedded content.

### 2.15 E-11.15: CPSC-Governed Agentic Development Framework

CGAD treats agents (human or AI) as untrusted proposal generators whose actions
are accepted only if projection into a constraint-defined state space succeeds.
Unlike conventional agentic systems that assign authority through procedural
workflows, CGAD uses a five-component architecture: agents proposing changes,
Constraint Architecture Specification (CAS) defining declarative system state,
projection engines resolving validity, version control ledgers recording
accepted proposals, and execution observers extracting state from external
systems. The canonical pipeline (Agent Action → Proposal Capture → State
Injection → Constraint Projection → Accept/Reject → Ledger Recording) provides
deterministic enforcement of correctness, structural elimination of drift,
tool-agnostic agent integration, hardware–software unified governance, and
reproducible auditable development processes.

### 2.16 E-11.16: Hardware Fabric Agentic Governance

CGAD applied to hardware development workflows governs FPGA/SoC platforms with
processing systems, programmable logic, remote SSH access, and debugging tools.
State variables include hardware configuration identifiers, bitstream identity,
executable binary status, debug instrumentation configuration, and provenance
metadata. Constraints enforce that debug instrumentation requires compatible
hardware configuration, executable code requires recorded provenance, benchmarks
require passing regression tests, and remote access requires validated
credentials. In the DDF embodiment, CGAD governs proto-cell fabric workflows
where agent proposals like "rebuild bitstream", "sync to target", or "run
regression" are accepted only when projection validates regression status,
bitstream build mode, and phase boundaries.

### 2.17 E-11.17: Specification-First Development Governance

CGAD enforces spec-first discipline in software development by modeling
requirement references, plan presence, regression status, wrapper script usage,
ledger updates, and benchmark execution as constrained state. Agent proposals
such as "run benchmark", "update compression pipeline", or "push to git" project
into validity only when constraints are satisfied: non-trivial changes must
reference requirements, `save session` must update ledgers, and
benchmark-dependent work must record fresh benchmark runs. This structural
enforcement prevents drift between requirements, code, tests, benchmarks, and
documentation, making spec-first discipline mathematical rather than
aspirational. The framework applies uniformly across programming languages,
toolchains, and domains.

### 2.18 E-11.18: Session Governance and Anti-Drift Mechanisms

Long-running agent sessions are governed by externalizing session
characteristics (intent summaries, assumptions, active goals) into explicit
state variables rather than implicit conversational context. Constraints enforce
bounded active goals (not exceeding declared limits), mandatory assumption
refresh after specified thresholds (number of actions or elapsed time), and
rejection of contradictory session state (mutually exclusive goals or intent
summaries). Session state is recorded in version control ledgers alongside code
changes, enabling deterministic replay and forensic analysis of agent behavior.
This prevents long-session slowdown and cognitive drift by forcing periodic
projection and reconciliation.

### 2.19 E-11.19: Prompt-Code Instrumentation and Intent Binding

Conversational intent in programming-by-dialogue is modeled as explicit state
variables coupled to implementation artifacts via declarative constraints.
Prompts, intent summaries, unresolved questions, and declared requirements are
represented as CGAD state variables. Constraints enforce that code changes
correspond to declared intent changes, unresolved conversational ambiguities
block acceptance of related implementation, and implementation artifacts cover
declared intent scope. This ensures programming by dialogue is reconstructible
and auditable, code artifacts are explainable by construction, and hallucinated
or implicit requirements are structurally excluded. Intent state is versioned
alongside code in version control, enabling bidirectional traceability between
conversational prompts and accepted code changes.
