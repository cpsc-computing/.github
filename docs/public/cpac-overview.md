# Constraint-Projected Adaptive Compression (CPAC)
## High-Level Overview

**Audience:** engineers, architects, technically literate readers.  
**Status:** high-level explainer, not legal or claim language.

## 1. What is CPAC, in one sentence?

Constraint-Projected Adaptive Compression (CPAC) is a way to compress structured data by:

> Making sure data obeys a set of explicit constraints first, then expressing only the truly independent choices (degrees of freedom), and finally using conventional prediction and entropy coding on that simplified representation.

It is not a replacement for entropy coders or predictors. It is a **front-end** that prepares data in a cleaner, more structured way before those familiar tools run.

## 2. Why is CPAC different from typical compression?

Most general-purpose compressors treat data as an opaque byte stream:

- They look for repeated patterns and statistical regularities,
- But they do not know anything about the **meaning** of your fields (headers, checksums, flags, relationships).

In many real systems, data has a lot of **built-in structure**, for example:

- Checksums, lengths, and indices that can be recomputed,
- Fields that are fully determined by others,
- Ranges and invariants that are always enforced by higher-level logic.

CPACs key idea:

- Do not waste bits encoding things that are *guaranteed* by structure.
- Instead, encode a minimal, structure-respecting representation and reconstruct the rest on decode.

## 3. How CPAC fits with CPSC

CPAC is built on top of the CPSC paradigm:

1. CPSC defines a **constraint-based state space**:
   - Variables and constraints describe what valid states look like.

2. CPAC uses that model to:
   - Map raw data into a structured state,
   - Enforce constraints,
   - Identify degrees of freedom (DoFs).

3. The rest of the compression pipeline operates on DoFs and (optionally) residuals or distributions.

In other words:

- CPSC = "what states are allowed and how we project into them,"  
- CPAC = "how we use that projection to get a compact, well-structured representation for compression."

## 4. Conceptual three-stage pipeline

At a high level, CPAC can be thought of as three conceptual stages:

1. **Constraint projection and structuring**
   - Interpret incoming data as a structured state according to a model (fields, relationships, invariants).
   - Apply constraints to:
     - Validate or correct structure where possible,
     - Distinguish between independent choices and derived values.
   - Identify a **degree-of-freedom vector**: a compact set of values that uniquely determines a valid structured state under the constraints.

2. **Prediction (optional)**
   - Optionally apply a **predictor** over the DoF sequence:
     - This predictor can be classical or learned.
   - Use the predictor to form:
     - Residuals between actual and predicted DoFs, or
     - Probability distributions over DoFs.

3. **Entropy coding**
   - Run a standard entropy coder (e.g., arithmetic coding, ANS, Huffman-style) on:
     - The DoFs and/or residuals,
     - Optionally some side information about the structure.

On decode:

- Entropy decode > reconstruct DoFs (and any predictor outputs you need),
- Feed DoFs into the same constraint-based model,
- Project back to a full structured state that satisfies the constraints.

The important part is that **structural correctness** is enforced at both ends of the pipeline.

## 5. What CPAC does *not* do

CPAC is **not**:

- A new entropy coding algorithm,
- A specific neural architecture,
- A one-size-fits-all codec for arbitrary data.

Instead:

- It sits **before and around** existing coding techniques,
- It offers a principled way to:
  - Respect structure,
  - Eliminate redundant or implied fields,
  - Make predictors lives easier by giving them a cleaner, constraint-consistent signal.

---

## 6. Where CPAC helps (examples without specifics)

CPAC is especially relevant when:

- Your data has strong **internal relationships**:
  - Protocols, logs, traces, telemetric data, records, config snapshots, structured binary formats.
- You need **exact reconstruction** and possibly:
  - Built-in sanity checks (does this decode make sense structurally?),
  - The ability to replay or validate state consistently across systems.

Examples of potential benefits (informal):

- **Smaller payloads** for highly structured domains:
  - Because CPAC removes structurally implied redundancy before running a classic compressor.
- **Better integrity checking**:
  - Because decoding inherently involves re-checking constraints.
- **Cleaner interfaces for learned components**:
  - Predictors can operate over degrees of freedom in a constraint-respecting space instead of raw bytes.

---

## 7. How CPAC interacts with learned models (at a high level)

CPAC is compatible with both classical and learned predictors:

- Predictors see:
  - Sequences of **degrees of freedom**,
  - Which already obey structural constraints.
- Predictors output:
  - Guesses for future DoFs,
  - Or distributions over DoFs.
- CPAC then:
  - Encodes residuals or distribution-driven codes,
  - Still relies on the constraint-based model for reconstruction and validation.

Key point:

> CPAC does not rely on the predictor being perfect. It merely uses prediction to improve coding efficiency, while constraints and projection ensure correctness.

---

## 8. Summary

- **CPAC** is a structured compression front-end built on top of CPSC.
- It respects and uses semantic structure explicitly, without replacing existing coding techniques.
- It keeps the semantics of your data clear and testable while still taking advantage of classical and learned prediction and standard entropy coding.
