# Constraint-Projected PQC: Technical Overview and Impact (Draft for Grants)

## 1. High-Level Concept

This project develops a new execution paradigm, **Constraint-Projected State Computing (CPSC)**, and applies it to **post-quantum cryptography (PQC)** and compression.

Instead of executing ordered instructions, a CPSC system treats computation as:

> Projecting system state into a space defined by explicit constraints, and committing only those states that satisfy the constraints.

A related technique, **Constraint-Projected Adaptive Compression (CPAC)**, uses this model to eliminate structural redundancy before prediction and entropy coding.

Our PQC embodiments apply CPSC/CPAC to cryptographic state so that signatures, ciphertexts, and keys are handled as **degree-of-freedom (DoF) vectors** over a constrained cryptographic state manifold, rather than as opaque byte strings.

## 2. What We Do Differently (Technical Differentiators)

1. **Constraint-Projected PQC Verification**  
   - Represent PQC algorithms (e.g., lattice-based and hash-based signatures, KEMs) as explicit constraint models over cryptographic state variables.  
   - Treat verification as projecting a candidate artifact (encoded as a DoF vector) into this state space, rather than running imperative verification code.  
   - A projected state that satisfies all constraints corresponds to a valid artifact; failure to project corresponds to rejection.

2. **DoF vs. Derived Cryptographic State**  
   - Decompose cryptographic state into:  
     - **Degrees of freedom (DoFs):** entropy-bearing variables that must be transmitted or stored.  
     - **Derived variables:** deterministic functions of DoFs and fixed parameters.  
     - **Fixed variables:** public parameters, algorithm constants, and policy data.  
   - Store/transmit only DoFs; reconstruct all derived structure (expanded lattices, Merkle nodes, matrix products, etc.) deterministically during projection.

3. **Instruction-Free Hardware Fabric for PQC**  
   - Implement constraint-projected cryptographic execution in FPGA/ASIC as a **constraint fabric**: state registers, parallel constraint-evaluation units, projection/relaxation networks, and commit logic.  
   - No instruction stream or program counter; behavior is defined entirely by constraints and configuration.  
   - This makes PQC verification deterministic, replayable, and easier to reason about than microcoded accelerators.

4. **CPAC for Cryptographic State**  
   - Apply constraint-projected DoF extraction to compress PQC state and verification artifacts without changing cryptographic assumptions.  
   - Compression removes structurally implied redundancy (derived structure), not cryptographic entropy, and guarantees exact reconstruction via projection.

5. **Constraint-Based PQC Migration and Governance**  
   - Use the same constraint architecture to model mixed classical–PQC deployments ("dual stack"), including cipher-suite choices, certificate chains, and rollout policies.  
   - Migration plans and runtime configurations are treated as states projected into a constraint-defined governance space, making it easier to prove that systems are quantum-safe by policy.

## 3. Why This Matters (Impact)

### 3.1 Technical Impact

- **Performance & Efficiency:**  
  - Reduces redundant recomputation in PQC verification by reconstructing only what is needed from a compact DoF vector.  
  - Enables hardware fabrics tuned for constraint evaluation instead of instruction execution, improving throughput and energy efficiency for PQC-heavy workloads.

- **Determinism & Verifiability:**  
  - Makes cryptographic correctness a question of constraint satisfaction, not of following specific code paths.  
  - Supports deterministic, instruction-free implementations that are easier to test, replay, and certify.

- **Interoperability & Portability:**  
  - Separates **what** a cryptographic system must do (constraints, invariants, degrees of freedom) from **how and where** it is executed (CPU, FPGA, ASIC, quantum or other accelerators).  
  - The same semantic model can govern multiple backends and evolve as standards change.

### 3.2 Application Domains

- **Cloud and Data Center Security:** PQC verification and key management offload engines, with clear semantics and hardware realizations.
- **Embedded / IoT Devices:** Low-power, deterministic PQC verification fabrics and compressed state representations for constrained devices.
- **Regulated Sectors:** Stronger guarantees around cryptographic posture, migration to PQC, and auditability.
- **AI and Data Systems:** Governance of cryptographic state, compressed telemetry, and structured logs using the same constraint-projected mechanisms.

## 4. Planned IP Strategy (High-Level)

- **Near term (this proposal):**  
  - File U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 63/XXX,XXX (*Constraint-Projected State Computing Systems, Semantic System Specification, and Applications*, CPSC-CPAC-Provisional-2026-01, filing date February 2026) covering:  
    - The core CPSC/CPAC paradigm,  
    - Cryptographic and PQC-specific embodiments (verification pipeline, DoF/derived decomposition, hardware fabrics, compression, and governance).  
  - Maintain internal prior-art notes and search logs to inform later claim drafting.

- **With grant funding:**  
  - Engage specialized patent counsel to perform a formal prior-art search and freedom-to-operate analysis.  
  - Convert the provisional into one or more non-provisional applications (and, as appropriate, PCT or foreign filings) with refined claims that reflect the search results and commercialization plans.  
  - Use counsel to manage portfolio strategy (dividing core platform, PQC applications, and other applications into coordinated filings).
