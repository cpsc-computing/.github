## 3. Background

### 3.1 Instruction-Driven Computing

* Define instruction execution, control flow, mutable state
* Limitations:

  * implicit invariants
  * difficulty enforcing correctness
  * complexity in safety-critical systems

### 3.2 Constraint Programming & Solvers

* SAT / MaxSAT / CSP systems as *tools*, not substrates
* Episodic invocation
* Lack of system-wide state semantics

### 3.3 Optimization & Numerical Methods

* Floating-point dependence
* Tolerance-based convergence
* Platform variance

### 3.4 Learned & Adaptive Systems

* Opaque behavior
* Non-determinism
* Certification difficulty

### 3.5 Unsolved Problem

> No existing paradigm defines computation itself as deterministic projection of state into an explicitly constrained space, independent of instruction sequencing, learning, or heuristic optimization.

Certain emerging paradigms, including quantum computing, further illustrate this gap. Existing quantum programming approaches typically describe low-level gate sequences, algorithm families, or Hamiltonian energy functions, and do not provide a stable, declarative layer for specifying what must be true of acceptable solutions, what constraints define correctness, or what invariants must hold across different hardware generations and algorithmic realizations. As a result, semantic intent is often entangled with execution methods and hardware details, complicating audit, governance, and long-term reuse.

This paragraph is **critical**.

## 5. Brief Description of the Drawings

Enumerate figures (FIG. 1–FIG. N)
Each with **one-sentence purpose**

This is largely identical to your provisional, but formalized, with additional figures reserved for Theme H cryptographic embodiments, for example:

- FIG. 10 — Constraint-projected post-quantum verification pipeline (artifact as degree-of-freedom vector over cryptographic state, projection to a valid state or failure).
- FIG. 11 — Cryptographic state manifold with independent (DoF) and derived variables for a representative post-quantum digital signature.
- FIG. 12 — Hardware constraint fabric specialized for post-quantum verification, showing state registers, constraint units, and commit logic executing verification without an instruction stream.

## 6. Definitions

Formal, examiner-friendly definitions:

* State
* Constraint
* Projection
* Valid state
* Degree of freedom
* Epoch
* Canonical valid state
* Constraint fabric
* Semantic System Specification (SSS) — a design-time representation describing system intent, variable roles, and invariant relationships independently of execution mechanics, which may in some embodiments be expressed in a structured text format such as a YAML-based encoding (for example, "Semantic-YAML"), without limiting the invention to any particular syntax

These definitions are later **referenced in claims**.

### 9.4 Backend-Agnostic and Non-Von-Neumann Execution

Describe how the same semantic system specification and constraint architecture can drive multiple execution backends:

* Classical deterministic CPSC engines
* Quantum realizations (gate-based circuits, Hamiltonians, annealing)
* Neuromorphic or analog fabrics
* Learned or AI-assisted proposal mechanisms (NN, RL, LLM)

Emphasize that correctness conditions and acceptable outcome sets are defined at the SSS / constraint-architecture level, not by any specific backend.
