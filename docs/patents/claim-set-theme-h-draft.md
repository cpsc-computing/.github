## 7. Notes for Counsel

- These claims are **deliberately broad** and may need to be split across multiple independent/dependent claim sets depending on jurisdictional practice and examiner feedback.
- Counsel should consider:
  - whether Claim 1 (paradigm) remains in the anchor family while Claim 2+ moves to a Theme H continuation, or
  - whether Theme H should have its own independent paradigm-style claim referencing cryptographic state specifically.
- All algorithm names (ML-DSA, SLH-DSA, ML-KEM) are intended as examples and should be framed non-limitingly in any filed claim language.
