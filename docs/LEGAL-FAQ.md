# Legal FAQ for Researchers and Academics
## Constraint-Projected State Computing (CPSC)

This document provides plain-language guidance on the **CPSC Research & Evaluation License**.
It is intended to help researchers, educators, and reviewers understand what is permitted.
This FAQ is informational only and does not replace the LICENSE file.

---

## 1. What is CPSC?

Constraint-Projected State Computing (CPSC) is a declarative computing model in which
computation is performed by projecting system state onto explicitly defined constraints,
rather than executing ordered instructions.

---

## 2. Who is this license intended for?

This license is intended for:
- Academic researchers
- University labs
- Educators and students
- Independent researchers
- Technical reviewers and evaluators

It is **not** intended for commercial deployment or product development.

---

## 3. Can I read and study the CPSC specification?

Yes. You are free to read, study, and analyze the CPSC specification for research,
evaluation, and educational purposes.

---

## 4. Can I cite CPSC in a paper, thesis, or presentation?

Yes. Citation and academic reference are explicitly permitted.

Please include the required attribution:
“Constraint-Projected State Computing (CPSC) — used under the CPSC Research & Evaluation License.”

---

## 5. Can I share the specification with colleagues or students?

Yes, provided that:
- the use is non-commercial,
- the license notice is preserved, and
- the materials are not used in production systems.

---

## 6. Can I implement CPSC as part of a research project?

Yes. You may implement CPSC for **non-commercial research or evaluation**.

This includes:
- prototypes
- simulations
- experiments
- benchmarking
- validation studies

Implementations must not be used in production or revenue-generating environments.

---

## 7. Can I publish experimental results or benchmarks?

Yes. Publishing results, performance data, comparisons, and analysis is permitted,
as long as the underlying implementation is not used commercially.

---

## 8. Can I release my research code publicly?

You may release research code **if**:
- it is clearly labeled as non-commercial research,
- it is not marketed as production-ready,
- and it does not grant commercial usage rights.

Commercial reuse of such code still requires a separate license.

---

## 9. Can my university or lab use CPSC internally?

Yes, for:
- academic research
- teaching
- internal evaluation

However, **industry partnerships, sponsored research with commercial deliverables,
or technology transfer activities require a commercial license**.

---

## 10. Can I use CPSC in a startup, spin-out, or industry collaboration?

No. Any commercial, pre-commercial, or industry-facing use requires a
separate commercial license from BitConcepts, LLC.

This includes:
- startups
- pilot deployments
- proof-of-concept products
- customer-facing demonstrations

---

## 11. Does this license grant patent rights?

No. The license does not grant any patent rights.

The CPSC specification may describe technologies that are subject to existing or future
patent applications. All patent rights are reserved.

---

## 12. Why isn’t CPSC open source?

CPSC is released under a research and evaluation license to:
- enable academic collaboration,
- support peer review and validation,
- and preserve intellectual property for future licensing,
  commercialization, and standardization.

This approach is common for foundational technologies that bridge
research and industry.

---

## 13. How do I obtain a commercial license?

For commercial licensing inquiries, please contact BitConcepts, LLC.

---

## 14. Where should I look for the authoritative terms?

The LICENSE file is the authoritative legal document.
If there is any conflict between this FAQ and the LICENSE, the LICENSE controls.
