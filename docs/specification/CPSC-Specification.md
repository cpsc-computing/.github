## Abstract

Constraint-Projected State Computing (CPSC) defines a computational model in which computation is performed by projecting system state onto a space defined by explicit constraints, rather than by executing ordered instructions. This document specifies the conceptual model, execution mechanics, degrees-of-freedom formulation, stage-based composition, software and hardware implementation guidance, and binary interchange requirements. It is intended to serve as the authoritative reference for building deterministic, constraint-driven systems in software, compression pipelines, control systems, and FPGA/ASIC architectures.

---

## 1. Motivation

Many real-world systems are governed primarily by rules rather than algorithms:
physical limits, safety conditions, protocol invariants, structural relationships, and conservation laws. Traditional instruction-based computing handles these indirectly through control logic, tuning, and exception handling, which increases complexity and fragility as systems grow.

CPSC addresses this by making **constraints the primary computational primitive**.

---

## 2. Core Principle

CPSC reframes computation as follows:

- **State** represents the full configuration of a system.
- **Constraints** define which configurations are valid.
- **Computation** is the act of resolving state into validity.

There is no instruction order, program counter, or sequential control flow.
Only the final valid state has semantic meaning.

---

## 3. State Model

A CPSC system operates on a **state** defined as a finite set of variables:

```

S = { v₁, v₂, …, vₙ }

```

Each variable MUST define:
- a unique identifier
- a type
- a domain or bounds
- optional derivation status

The state fully represents the system at a given moment.

---

## 4. Constraint Model

A **constraint** is a declarative, side-effect-free rule over one or more variables.

Constraints:
- evaluate to satisfied or violated
- do not mutate state directly
- may overlap in variable scope
- may conflict with other constraints

Constraint evaluation order is undefined and MUST NOT affect results.

---

## 5. Projection: The Fundamental Operation

All computation in CPSC is performed by **projection**.

Given a proposed state `S₀`, projection produces a valid state `Sᵥ`:

```

P(S₀) → Sᵥ

```

Projection consists of:
1. Evaluating all constraints
2. Identifying violations
3. Applying bounded corrections
4. Iterating until convergence or declared limits

Intermediate states are not observable and have no semantic meaning.

---

## 6. Determinism and Convergence

A compliant CPSC implementation MUST:
- converge deterministically under declared bounds
- produce the same valid state given the same inputs and parameters
- report failure if convergence cannot be achieved

The specific numerical solver is implementation-defined, but:
- correction magnitudes MUST be bounded
- numeric precision MUST be explicit
- convergence criteria MUST be declared

---

## 7. Degrees of Freedom

Each variable in the state MUST belong to exactly one category:

- **Fixed**: invariant across all valid states
- **Derived**: fully determined by constraints
- **Free**: independent parameters of the valid state space

The **degree-of-freedom (DoF) vector** is the minimal information required to reconstruct a valid state.

This concept is central to:
- compression
- streaming systems
- hardware acceleration
- state reconstruction

---

## 8. Stage-Based System Composition

CPSC systems are built as **explicit stages**, not instruction flows.

A canonical pipeline:

```

Input
→ Predictor (optional)
→ CPSC Projection
→ Degree-of-Freedom Extraction
→ Residual Encoding (optional)
→ Entropy Coding (optional)

```

Each stage MUST:
- be explicitly declared
- be reconstructible or invertible
- emit sufficient metadata for reconstruction

---

## 9. Predictor Integration

Predictive components (e.g., neural networks) MAY be used to propose initial states.

Predictors:
- MUST NOT enforce correctness
- MUST NOT bypass constraints
- MAY be replaced or removed without affecting correctness

CPSC projection is the sole authority on validity.

---

## 10. Binary Interchange and Reconstruction

CPSC defines a simple, deterministic binary representation for storing or transmitting:
- degrees of freedom
- optional residuals
- reconstruction metadata

Reconstruction proceeds as:
1. Parse binary header
2. Validate model metadata
3. Load constraint model
4. Inject DoF values
5. Apply residuals (if present)
6. Run CPSC projection
7. Emit valid state

The same process applies in software and hardware.

---

## 11. Software Implementation Guidance

A compliant software implementation SHOULD provide:
- a constraint model loader
- a deterministic projection engine
- DoF extraction and injection
- batch and streaming operation modes

Python implementations define reference semantics.
Rust and C++ implementations target performance and deployment.

---

## 12. Hardware Implementation Guidance

CPSC maps naturally to hardware as a **constraint fabric**.

A canonical hardware structure:

```

State Registers
→ Constraint Evaluation Units (parallel)
→ Projection / Update Network
→ Convergence Detection
→ Valid State Output

```

Properties:
- no instruction sequencing
- no program counter
- local, parallel interactions
- fixed-point friendly arithmetic
- streamable operation

One non-limiting class of hardware embodiments realizes the constraint fabric as a regular array or graph of **proto-cells** under control of a global **epoch controller**. In such embodiments, each proto-cell holds local configuration and state, exchanges signals with neighboring proto-cells, and applies fixed local update rules, while an epoch controller orchestrates globally synchronized epochs with commit-only state updates. This arrangement preserves the CPSC requirement that, for a fixed initial state, configuration, and epoch schedule, the sequence of projected states is deterministic. Other hardware fabrics that satisfy the same constraint-projected state semantics, but use different internal organizations, remain within the scope of this specification.

## 13. Applications

CPSC is applicable to, but not limited to:

- file and streaming compression
- semantic and structure-aware compression
- telemetry and logging reduction
- protocol enforcement and validation
- power electronics and control systems
- deterministic inference pipelines
- edge and embedded systems
- FPGA and ASIC acceleration
- secure state reconstruction
- constraint-governed agentic development (CGAD), in which agent proposals are treated as candidate states and correctness is defined solely by projection into a shared constraint model

---

## 14. Non-Goals

CPSC does not define:
- learning or training algorithms
- automatic constraint discovery
- general-purpose programming semantics
- user interfaces or visualization layers

## 16. Summary

Constraint-Projected State Computing defines computation as the resolution of valid system states under explicit constraints. By operating on degrees of freedom rather than instruction sequences, CPSC enables deterministic, parallel, and hardware-aligned computation across software and physical systems.

This document is the authoritative technical specification for CPSC.
