# Draft Claim Set – CPSC Core (Non-Provisional)

NOTE: This document is an internal technical draft intended to guide formal
claim drafting. It is not legal advice and is not a filed claim set.

---

## Independent Claim

1. A method of computation, comprising:
   - defining a system state comprising a plurality of variables;
   - defining a set of declarative constraints over the system state;
   - receiving a proposed state;
   - deterministically projecting the proposed state into a valid state that
     satisfies the set of constraints or reporting failure;
   wherein computation is defined by projection of state into the
   constraint-defined space rather than by execution of an ordered instruction
   sequence.

## Core Dependent Claims

2. The method of claim 1, wherein the projection is performed under bounded
   execution rules guaranteeing deterministic behavior.

3. The method of claim 1, further comprising identifying a set of degrees of
   freedom sufficient to reconstruct the valid state.

4. The method of claim 3, wherein remaining variables are fixed or derived by
   the constraints.

5. The method of claim 1, wherein state updates occur only at discrete commit
   boundaries.

---

## Validation and Certification Claims

6. The method of claim 1, further comprising validating a canonical valid state
   by re-projecting the valid state and verifying invariance.

7. The method of claim 6, wherein validation is performed only outside runtime
   execution.

---

## Hardware Embodiment Claims

8. The method of claim 1, wherein projection is implemented in hardware without
   instruction execution.

9. The method of claim 8, wherein the hardware comprises a constraint fabric
   including state registers, constraint evaluation units, and commit logic.

10. The method of claim 8, wherein the hardware enforces resource or security
    policies deterministically.

## CPAC (Compression) Claims

11. The method of claim 3, further comprising encoding only the degrees of
    freedom for storage or transmission.

12. The method of claim 11, further comprising entropy coding the degrees of
    freedom or residuals.

13. The method of claim 11, wherein reconstruction comprises injecting the
    degrees of freedom and projecting to recover the valid state.

---

## Control and Safety Claims

14. The method of claim 1, wherein the system state represents actuator commands
    and constraints encode safety envelopes.

15. The method of claim 14, wherein projection deterministically produces valid
    actuator commands or failure.

---

## AI Governance Claims

16. The method of claim 1, wherein the proposed state is generated by a learned
    system.

17. The method of claim 16, wherein projection enforces policy or safety
    constraints on outputs of the learned system.
