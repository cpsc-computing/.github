# Patent Continuation Strategy – CPSC / CPAC

This document outlines the recommended strategy for non-provisional and
continuation patent filings following the foundational CPSC provisional.

---

## Guiding Principle

One foundational paradigm supports multiple focused patent families.
Continuations should specialize without re-framing the core invention.

---

## Priority 1 — CPSC Core Non-Provisional (Anchor)

### Timing
- Approximately 9–12 months from provisional filing

### Scope
- Constraint-Projected State Computing as a computing paradigm
- Deterministic projection semantics
- Degrees of freedom
- Hardware and software embodiments
- Validation-time recursion-stability

### Rationale
- Broadest protection
- Hardest to design around
- Defends all other application-specific families

---

## Priority 2 — CPAC (Compression and Structural Reduction)

### Timing
- Approximately 12–18 months from provisional filing

### Scope
- Structural elimination via constraints
- DoF-based compression
- Prediction-optional correctness
- Streaming and replayable formats

### Rationale
- Clear commercial value
- Easier benchmarking and demonstration
- Strong differentiation vs prior art compression

---

## Priority 3 — Hardware Constraint Fabrics and Governance

### Timing
- Approximately 18–24 months from provisional filing

### Scope
- FPGA / ASIC implementations
- Epoch-based commit execution
- On-chip policy and resource enforcement
- Deterministic isolation

### Rationale
- High-value licensing
- Longer sales cycles
- Strong moat once filed

---

## Conditional Priority — Control vs AI Governance

Selection should be based on traction.

### Option A — Control and Mission-Critical Systems
- Aerospace
- Industrial automation
- Robotics
- Energy systems

### Option B — AI / LLM / Neural Governance
- AI safety and regulation
- Enterprise AI deployments
- Defense and medical AI

One may be filed first; the other can follow as a continuation.

---

## Long-Term View

- Maintain the ability to file additional continuations for:
  - security enforcement,
  - telemetry and replay,
  - embedded systems,
  - specialized hardware domains.

- Avoid narrowing the anchor patent.
- Use continuations to adapt to market pull.

---

## Internal Tracking Recommendation

Track each family with:
- filing date
- priority chain
- status
- expiration timeline
