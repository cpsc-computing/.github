## Abstract

This document specifies the **CPSC Binary Format**, a deterministic, streamable binary representation used to encode degrees of freedom, optional residuals, and reconstruction metadata for Constraint-Projected State Computing (CPSC). The format is designed for efficient software execution, compatibility with hardware implementations, and deterministic reconstruction of valid system state.

---

## 1. Purpose and Scope

The CPSC Binary Format defines how CPSC state information is serialized for:

- storage
- transmission
- compression pipelines
- streaming interfaces

This format is **not** a general-purpose container.
It exists solely to support CPSC reconstruction semantics.

---

## 2. Design Goals

The binary format is designed to be:

- Deterministic
- Self-describing
- Streamable
- Hardware-compatible
- Versioned
- Minimal

It avoids:
- dynamic allocation
- recursion
- variable control structures
- hidden execution semantics

---

## 3. High-Level Structure

A CPSC binary blob consists of the following ordered sections:

```

[Header]
[Model Metadata]
[Stage Table]
[Degree-of-Freedom Vector]
[Residual Stream] (optional)

```

All sections appear in the order listed.

---

## 4. Header

### 4.1 Header Purpose

The header allows:
- fast identification
- version validation
- endian detection
- early rejection of incompatible blobs

---

### 4.2 Header Fields

| Field | Size | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Magic | 4 bytes | ASCII "CPSC" |
| Format Version | 2 bytes | Binary format version |
| Flags | 2 bytes | Feature flags |
| Endianness | 1 byte | 0 = little, 1 = big |
| Numeric Mode | 1 byte | Fixed / floating |
| Reserved | 6 bytes | Must be zero |

Total header size: **16 bytes**

---

## 5. Model Metadata Section

### 5.1 Purpose

This section binds the binary blob to a specific CPSC model.

---

### 5.2 Fields

| Field | Size | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Model ID Hash | 32 bytes | Hash of CAS-YAML model_id |
| CAS Hash | 32 bytes | Hash of resolved CAS-YAML |
| DoF Count | 4 bytes | Number of free variables |
| Precision Bits | 2 bytes | Numeric precision |
| Reserved | 2 bytes | Must be zero |

---

## 6. Stage Table

### 6.1 Purpose

The stage table describes which pipeline stages were applied during encoding.

This enables:
- forward compatibility
- partial decoding
- implementation-specific routing decisions

---

### 6.2 Structure

```

[Stage Count] (2 bytes)
[Stage Entries...]

```

Each stage entry:

| Field | Size | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Stage ID | 2 bytes | Symbolic stage identifier |
| Flags | 2 bytes | Stage-specific flags |
| Reserved | 4 bytes | Must be zero |

---

## 7. Degree-of-Freedom Vector

### 7.1 Purpose

This section encodes the **minimal independent state information**.

---

### 7.2 Layout

```

[DoF₁][DoF₂]...[DoFₙ]

```

Each DoF value:
- uses declared numeric mode
- uses declared precision
- appears in deterministic order defined by CAS-YAML

This section is fixed-size once the model is known.

---

## 8. Residual Stream (Optional)

### 8.1 Purpose

Residuals encode deviations not captured by DoF alone.

This section is optional and may be omitted if not required.

---

### 8.2 Semantics

- Residuals are applied before final projection
- Residual decoding MUST be deterministic
- Residuals MUST NOT violate declared constraints

---

## 9. Streaming Properties

The binary format is designed to support streaming operation:

- Header and metadata are small and fixed-size
- The degree-of-freedom vector is sequential and bounded
- The residual stream may be processed incrementally

Streaming behavior MUST preserve determinism.

---

## 10. Reconstruction Algorithm (Normative)

To reconstruct a valid state:

1. Parse header
2. Validate format version
3. Read model metadata
4. Load CAS-YAML model
5. Inject degree-of-freedom values
6. Apply residuals (if present)
7. Run CPSC projection
8. Emit valid state

Failure at any step MUST abort reconstruction.

---

## 11. Validation Rules

A binary blob is valid only if:

- Magic and version match expected values
- Model hash matches the resolved CAS-YAML
- Degree-of-freedom count matches the model
- Numeric modes and precision are compatible
- Reserved fields are zero

---

## 12. Relationship to Other Specifications

This document depends on:

- `CPSC-Specification.md`
- `CAS-YAML-Specification.md`

Hardware signal-level interpretation and RTL mapping are defined in:

- `Binary-Format-RTL-Mapping.md`

This document does not define execution, projection, or constraint semantics.

---

## 13. Summary

The CPSC Binary Format provides a deterministic, compact, and implementation-agnostic representation of CPSC state information. It enables efficient storage, transmission, and reconstruction across software and hardware systems while remaining independent of specific execution architectures.

This document is the authoritative specification for the CPSC binary format.
